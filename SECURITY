Security Vulnerability Reporting
The OpenPolicy team prioritizes the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in our application. We value community contributions to improving our security posture and commit to responding promptly to all valid reports.

Reporting Guidelines
To report a potential security issue, contact us directly via email at support@openpolicy.com or through our dedicated Slack channel.

Follow these steps to ensure smooth handling:

Avoid automated scanning tools on our production systems or user interfaces. Reach out first, and we'll provision a testing environment.

Refrain from exploiting the issue beyond what's needed for proof-of-concept, such as excess data access or unauthorized changes.

Keep the details private until we've addressed and confirmed the fix.

Exclude physical attacks, social engineering, DDoS, spam, or third-party app exploits from your testing.

Include clear reproduction steps, like affected URLs, or vulnerability descriptions. More complex cases may need additional context like code snippets or logs.

Our Commitments
We'll acknowledge your report within 5 business days, including an initial assessment and timeline for resolution.

Provided you adhere to these guidelines, no legal action will be pursued regarding your disclosure.

Your report and personal information remain confidential; we won't share without explicit consent.

Regular updates will keep you informed on fix progress.

Upon resolution, we'll credit you publicly as the finder (opt-out available on request).

We aim for swift resolutions and collaborate on any post-fix disclosure.
